# Simple Todo App

a simple to-do app that allows users to record and organize their daily tasks efficiently. The app lets users add, edit, and delete tasks, assign due dates, and mark tasks as complete. It helps users stay productive by keeping track of deadlines and providing a clean, intuitive interface for managing their personal or work-related to-do lists

## Functionality

Users can:

Add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

Edit or update existing tasks to change details or adjust deadlines.

Mark tasks as completed to visually track progress.

Delete tasks once they’re no longer needed.

Sort or filter tasks by due date or completion status for better organization.

Receive visual feedback (such as color changes or icons) when tasks are completed or overdue.

## Technology

HTML5: Structured the layout and core elements of the app, including the task input fields, buttons, and task list display.

CSS3: Styled the interface for a clean and responsive user experience. Implemented visual indicators such as color-coded task states (e.g., completed or overdue) and layout responsiveness for both desktop and mobile screens.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handled the app’s functionality, including adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks. Used DOM manipulation to dynamically update the task list and manage user interactions in real time.

Local Storage API: Enabled persistent task data so that users’ to-do lists remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.
